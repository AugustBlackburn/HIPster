##Heuristic Imputation in Pedigrees
This program performs a heuristic phasing and imputation method described here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/qc/1753-6561/8/S1/S16
###HIPster_driver.pl
* This program calls subroutines stored in HIPster.pm to phase and impute genotype data in multigenerational pedigrees.
* Usage is as follows: >perl HIPster_driver.pl $ARGV[0] $ARGV[1] $ARGV[2]
* where $ARGV[0] is a .csv file holding a matrix of genotypes in 0,1,2 format (first column is SNP name, second column is chr, and third column is location, and missing genotypes are designated by a dash(-))
* $ARGV[1] is a Pedigree file in SOLAR format
* $ARGV[2] is the number of consecutive markers indicating a crossover event exists necessary to call a crossover event. We reccomend between 5 and 10

###Convert_012_to_HIPster_format.pl
* This program converts 012 format output by VCFtools to HIPster format
* Usage is as follows: >perl Convert_012_to_HIPster_format.pl $ARGV[0]
* where $ARGV[0] is the base name of the output files generated by VCFtools when converting to 012 format
